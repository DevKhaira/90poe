# 90POE
** 90POE tech test
**
**Steps to run the test
**

To run the test simple run

First yarn the module (please install yarn and node if required)

run the 90POE application locally (provided by 90POE)

then run 
yarn test

This will give you the results and the video itself

**If you want to see whats going on please run
**

yarn cypress open

You can see the test failures on cypress -> fixture -> video. Please fix before proceeding with the application.

I also recommend following the file structure. If you create a feature file x.feature create the folder x and x.ts to add steps. You will also need to put it in the the interfaces folder to show what functions you are going to add and add to types.
